# AI-Powered Educational Storytelling Project

## Introduction

You will use **state-of-the-art AI chatbots** to generate, evaluate, and enhance creative stories for children. You’ll practice:
- Crafting precise prompts,
- Comparing single vs multi-turn strategies,
- Rewriting for custom contexts,
- Adding curriculum-aligned educational elements,
- Creating comprehension quizzes, and
- Evaluating all outputs critically.

You’ll learn both **AI prompting skills** and how to assess outputs for quality, engagement, and educational value.

---

## Recommended Free AI Tools

- [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chat.openai.com/) — Free with account, high prompt limit (GPT-4.1 or GPT-5).
- [Google Gemini (Bard)](https://gemini.google.com/) — Free with Google account, unlimited prompts.
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) — Free on Edge browser, GPT-4 powered.

*Don’t use tools with severe daily prompt restrictions (e.g., xAI Grok).*

*Feel free to use your paid account or local models if you have access to them. But it is not required.*

## 1. Generate an Original Children’s Story

### a. Define Your Story Parameters

- **Child Age:** `<AGE>`
- **Child Gender/Identity:** `<GENDER/IDENTITY>`
- **Theme (Optional):** `<THEME>`
- **Moral/Lesson (Optional):** `<MORAL>`

### b. Single-Prompt Strategy

Use a prompt like:

> Write an original story for a <AGE>-year-old <GENDER/IDENTITY>. The story should be imaginative, age-appropriate, and teach a gentle lesson about <MORAL/LESSON>. Keep it engaging and suitable for reading aloud.

*Example:*

Write an original story for a 7-year-old boy. The story should be adventurous and teach a lesson about teamwork.


### c. Multi-Turn (Iterative) Strategy

Break the story generation into steps:

1. **Outline:**
    ```
    Outline a story for a <AGE>-year-old <GENDER/IDENTITY> about <THEME>. Suggest a creative plot and main characters.
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```
    Outline a story for a 6-year-old girl about a magical garden and a talking rabbit.
    ```

2. **Draft:**
    ```
    Write the story from the outline, using simple language for a <AGE>-year-old. Make it fun and easy to follow.
    ```

3. **Refine (optional):**
    ```
    Revise the story to include a clear lesson about <MORAL/LESSON>. Add more dialogue between the characters.
    ```

**Tip:** If the AI output isn’t perfect, adjust your prompt wording and iterate.

---

## 2. Evaluate the Generated Story

After each story, use these criteria to assess quality:

- **Age Appropriateness:** Is language and content suitable for `<AGE>`?
- **Clarity & Coherence:** Is the story logical, with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
- **Creativity & Engagement:** Are characters, setting, and plot fresh and interesting?
- **Language & Style:** Is it natural and pleasant to read aloud? Any awkwardness or repetitive phrasing?
- **Message/Moral:** If specified, is the lesson clear and gentle?
- **Literature quality:** Is it comparable with original children’s books?

**Example Evaluation Note:**
> The vocabulary fits a 5-year-old. The plot is coherent and the adventure is fun. The lesson about sharing is present but could be more explicit.

*Score each point 1–6*

---

## 3. Rewriting with Custom Characters or Setting

### a. Decide on the Context Change

- **New Setting:** `<NEW_SETTING>` (e.g., Minecraft, fairy tale kingdom)
- **New Characters:** `<CHARACTERS>` (e.g., Paw Patrol, prince/princess)
- **Other Changes:** `<GENRE/STYLE>`

### b. Rewrite Prompt Template
> Rewrite the above story for a <AGE>-year-old <GENDER/IDENTITY>. Set it in <NEW_SETTING> and include <CHARACTERS>. Keep the main plot and lesson about <MORAL/LESSON>, but adapt the details and style for this new context.

*Example:*
> Rewrite the above story for a 6-year-old girl. Set it in the world of Minecraft and make the main character a princess who teams up with Steve to explore a cave.



### c. Evaluate the Rewrite

- Are the new elements integrated naturally?
- Does the story remain clear and enjoyable?
- Is the original message preserved?

---

## 4. Add an Educational Layer

### a. Pick a Curriculum-Aligned Subject

- **Geography:** Characters visit real places, mention simple facts.
- **Science:** Simple explanations (volcanoes, rainbows, magnets).
- **History:** Introduce a figure/event, keep it fun and light.
- **Math:** Counting, shapes, puzzles, or logic for older kids.

### b. Education Enhancement Prompt
> Revise the story to include an educational element about <SUBJECT>. Insert a simple, accurate explanation or fact that fits naturally, appropriate for a <AGE>-year-old.

*Example:*
> Revise the story to include a simple explanation about how volcanoes erupt. Make sure it fits the adventure and is easy for a 7-year-old to understand.


### c. Evaluate

- Is the fact accurate and at the right level?
- Does it blend smoothly into the narrative?

---

## 5. Create a Comprehension Quiz

### a. Quiz Prompt
> Create <NUMBER> questions to test a <AGE>-year-old’s understanding of the story. Include at least one question about the educational content.

*Example:*

> Create 5 questions to test a 7-year-old’s understanding of the story, including one about volcanoes.

### b. Types of Questions

- Why did the character use iron sword and not a gold one?
- Which river they crossed was the biggest?
- Who was the king of the France in the story?
- How does a compass work?
- Why did Jake’s boat float, but his toy car did not?
- What plant did the group discover in the forest, and what color were its flowers?

### c. Review

- Are all questions answerable from the story?
- Are they clear and suitable for `<AGE>`?

---

## 6. Final Evaluation and Reflection

- Did the educational content enhance or disrupt the story?
- Were all facts accurate and explanations clear?
- Did you find single or multi-prompt strategies better?
- What worked, what didn’t, and what would you do differently?

---

## Deliverables

- All prompts (with parameters) and generated results (with parameters filled in)
- Evaluations for teammates’ stories
- Reflection comparing strategies, and your findings

---

*Experiment, iterate, and have fun creating stories and learning how to guide AI!*
