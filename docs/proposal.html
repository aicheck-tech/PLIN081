# AI-Powered Educational Storytelling Project

## Introduction

You will use **state-of-the-art AI chatbots** to generate, evaluate, and enhance creative stories for children. You’ll practice:
- Crafting precise prompts,
- Comparing single vs multi-turn strategies,
- Rewriting for custom contexts,
- Adding curriculum-aligned educational elements,
- Creating comprehension quizzes,
- Evaluating all outputs critically, and
- Annotating work of others for quality and feedback.

You’ll learn both **AI prompting skills** and how to assess outputs for quality, engagement, and educational value.

---

## Recommended Free AI Tools

- [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chat.openai.com/) — Free with account, high prompt limit (GPT-4.1 or GPT-5).
- [Google Gemini (Bard)](https://gemini.google.com/) — Free with Google account, unlimited prompts.
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) — Free on Edge browser, GPT-4 powered.

*Don’t use tools with severe daily prompt restrictions (e.g., xAI Grok).*

*You may use paid APIs or local LLMs if you prefer — but it's not required.*

## 1. Generate an Original Children’s Story

### a. Build-in Your Story Parameters

- **Age category:** preschool, early elementary, upper elementary, etc.
- **Theme:** pirates, space adventure, magical creatures, lost in a forest, time travel, etc.
- **Moral:** power of friendship, honesty, courage, nobody is perfect, etc.

### b. Single-Prompt Strategy
Use a prompt like:
> Write an original story for a 4–5-year-old children. The story should be imaginative about pirates, age-appropriate, and teach a gentle lesson about courage. The story should be engaging and easy to understand, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use simple language and vivid descriptions to capture the child's imagination.


### c. Multi-Turn (Iterative) Strategy
Break the story generation into steps:

1. **Outline**
    ```
    Outline an original story for a 10–13-year-old children. The story should be imaginative about talking animals.
    ```
2. **Draft**
    ```
    Write the story from the outline, using simple language for a 10-13-year-old. Make it fun and easy to follow.
    ```
3. **Refinement with moral or character style**
    ```
    Revise the story to include a gentle lesson about courage.
    ```

See example at [chatGPT snippet](https://chatgpt.com/share/68befcc5-1134-800d-83d8-6abb90896b2e).

## 2. Evaluate the Generated Story

Use these criteria (also used in annotation):

 - **Age Appropriateness:** Is language and content suitable for `<AGE>`?
 - **Clarity & Coherence:** Is the story logical, with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
 - **Creativity & Engagement:** Are characters, setting, and plot fresh and interesting?
 - **Language & Style:** Is it natural and pleasant to read aloud? Any awkwardness or repetitive phrasing?
 - **Message/Moral:** If specified, is the lesson clear and gentle?
 - **Literature quality:** Is it comparable with original children’s books?

Score each 0 (partial or no match) or 1 (perfect fit). See "Annotation" below for details.

Example how to score (be strict):

![Annotation Criteria](imgs/scoring.png)

 - Not suitable for children. Too adult themes.    (0 points)
 - Story is well presented and clear.              (1 point)
 - Unoriginal plot.                    (0 points)
 - Language is simple and easy to read aloud.      (1 point)
 - Moral is not communicated at the end.                     (0 points)
 - Writing style is too technical, not literary.        (0 points)

Create at least 10 stories with 6 points, 10 stories with at least 4 points and 10 stories with at least 2 points.
---

## 3. Rewrite with a New Theme and custom characters

Use placeholders `{age}` and `{theme}` and optional placeholders such as `{gender}`, `{main_character}`, `{side_character}`.

**Prompt Example:**
> Reimagine the previous story from the viewpoint of a wise old {side_character} guiding a {main_character} in a world of {theme}. The story should be suitable for a {age}-year-old child, maintaining the original plot but adapting the setting and characters to fit the new theme.

## 4. Evaluate rewritten story

Use these criteria (also used in annotation):

 - **Story Quality**: Is a story quality kept after change? Does the story remain clear and enjoyable?
 - **Theme**: Was theme change successful? Are the new elements integrated naturally?
 - **Roleplaying**: Does a story fit a character/theme?

Create at least 10 rewrites with 3 points and 10 rewrites with at least 2 points (use stories from step 2).

---

## 5. Add an Educational Layer

Revise the story to include simple explanations about:
 - **Geography:** Characters visit real places, mention simple facts.
 - **Science:** Simple explanations (volcanoes, rainbows, magnets).
 - **History:** Introduce a figure/event, keep it fun and light.
 - **Math:** Counting, shapes, puzzles, or logic for older kids.
 - Or others curriculum-aligned  opics.

Prompts:
> Add information about material properties (e.g., wood, metal) to the story and use these properties in story events and the character's decisions.

> Revise the story to include a simple explanation about how volcanoes erupt. Make sure it fits the adventure and is easy for a {age}-year-old to understand.

## 6. Evaluation

 - **Story Quality**: Is a story quality kept after change? Does the story remain clear and enjoyable?
 - **Naturalness**: Is the fact blended into the story seamlessly?
 - **Correctness**: Are ALL facts accurate?

Select two education topics (e.g. geography, art, biology) and for each of topics, create 10 stories (reusing your original stories from step 4 and applying a new prompt) with educational content.

---

## 7. Generate Questions and Responses (JSON)

Prompt:
> Generate three questions and responses as a JSON dictionary that check the listener's knowledge about the material properties mentioned in the story.

**Example JSON Output:**

```json
{
  "Why did he select an iron sword instead a gold one?": "Iron is harder than gold, golden one would break",
  "What did the compass help them do?": "It helped them find north through the fog",
  "Which object floated: the wooden raft or the rock?": "The raft floated because wood is less dense than water"
}
```

Use [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/) to validate your structure.

## 8. Evaluation

 - **Difficulty:** Are questions adequate for a given child’s age?
 - **Completeness:** Are questions testing knowledge from story?
 - **Correctness:** Are responses correct?

For each generated education story in step 6, generate a set of at least 3 questions and answers in a format `{"question1": "answer2", "question2": "answer2"}`.
---

## 9. Annotation Instructions

You will review stories written by others and annotate them using yes/no checkboxes.
You are requested to annotate at least 60 items original stories, 40 theme rewrites, 40 education rewrites and 40 questions/responses sets.

Annotations should be honest and constructive, if you are not sure, treat score as 0 (unchecked). Nobody won't be penalized for receiving low scores.

Each section has its own criteria, always marked 0 or 1:

### Category 1: LLM Story (60times)

- Age Appropriateness
- Clarity & Coherence
- Creativity & Engagement
- Language & Style
- Message/Moral
- Literature Quality

### Category 2: Theme Transformation (60times)

- Story Quality
- Theme
- Roleplaying

### Category 3: Education (40times)

- Story Quality
- Naturalness
- Correctness

### Category 4: Questions (40times)

- Difficulty
- Completeness
- Correctness

---

## Deliverables

- All prompts (with placeholders), placeholder values (as JSON), and LLM responses (with placeholders filled), 30 per section 1 and 2 and 20 per section 3 and 4 inserted into an [annotation interface](https://idc.aicheck.tech/dashboard).
- Peer annotations (60, 60, 40, 40) done in the annotation interface.
- Final reflection comparing strategies (200+ words) sent to the instructor:
    - Did the educational content enhance or disrupt the story?
    - Were all facts accurate and explanations clear?
    - Did you find single or multi-prompt strategies better?
    - What worked, what didn’t, and what would you do differently?
