# AI-Powered Educational Storytelling Project

## Introduction

You will use **state-of-the-art AI chatbots** to generate, evaluate, and enhance creative stories for children. You’ll practice:
- Crafting precise prompts,
- Comparing single vs multi-turn strategies,
- Rewriting for custom contexts,
- Adding curriculum-aligned educational elements,
- Creating comprehension quizzes,
- Evaluating all outputs critically, and
- Annotating work of others for quality and feedback.

You’ll learn both **AI prompting skills** and how to assess outputs for quality, engagement, and educational value.

---

## Recommended Free AI Tools

- [ChatGPT (OpenAI)](https://chat.openai.com/) — Free with account, high prompt limit (GPT-4.1 or GPT-5).
- [Google Gemini (Bard)](https://gemini.google.com/) — Free with Google account, unlimited prompts.
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) — Free on Edge browser, GPT-4 powered.

*Don’t use tools with severe daily prompt restrictions (e.g., xAI Grok).*

*You may use paid APIs or local LLMs if you prefer — but it's not required.*

---

## 1. Generate an Original Children’s Story

### a. Define Your Story Parameters

- **Age category:** `{age_category}` (e.g. 3–5, 6–8, 9–12)
- **Optional Theme:** `{theme}` (e.g. pirates, space adventure, magical creatures, lost in a forest, time travel)
- **Optional Moral:** `{Moral}` (e.g. power of friendship, honesty, courage, nobody is perfect)

### b. Single-Prompt Strategy
Use a prompt like:
> Write an original story for a {age_category}-year-old children. The story should be imaginative about {theme}, age-appropriate, and teach a gentle lesson about {moral}. The story should be engaging and easy to understand, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use simple language and vivid descriptions to capture the child's imagination.

*Example:*
Write an original story for a 4–5-year-old children. The story should be imaginative about pirates, age-appropriate, and teach a gentle lesson about courage. The story should be engaging and easy to understand, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Use simple language and vivid descriptions to capture the child's imagination.

### c. Multi-Turn (Iterative) Strategy
Break the story generation into steps:

1. **Outline**
    ```
    Outline an original story for a {age_category}-year-old children. The story should be imaginative about {theme}.
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```
    Outline an original story for a 10–13-year-old children. The story should be imaginative about talking animals.
    ```
2. **Draft**
    ```
    Write the story from the outline, using simple language for a {age_category}-year-old. Make it fun and easy to follow.
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```
    Write the story from the outline, using simple language for a 10-13-year-old. Make it fun and easy to follow.
    ```
3. **Refinement with moral or character style**
    ```
    Revise the story to include a gentle lesson about {moral}.
    ```
    *Example:*
    ```
    Revise the story to include a gentle lesson about courage.
    ```

## 2. Evaluate the Generated Story

Use these criteria (also used in annotation):

 - **Age Appropriateness:** Is language and content suitable for `<AGE>`?
 - **Clarity & Coherence:** Is the story logical, with a clear beginning, middle, and end?
 - **Creativity & Engagement:** Are characters, setting, and plot fresh and interesting?
 - **Language & Style:** Is it natural and pleasant to read aloud? Any awkwardness or repetitive phrasing?
 - **Message/Moral:** If specified, is the lesson clear and gentle?
 - **Literature quality:** Is it comparable with original children’s books?

Score each 0 or 1. See "Annotation" below for details.

Create at least 10 stories with 6 points, 10 stories with at least 4 points and 10 stories with at least 2 points.
---

## 3. Rewrite with a New Theme and custom characters

Use placeholders like `{age}`, `{gender}`, `{main_character}`, `{side_character}`.

**Prompt Example:**
> Reimagine the previous story from the viewpoint of a wise old {side_character} guiding a {main_character}.

## 4. Evaluate rewritten story

Use these criteria (also used in annotation):

 - **Story Quality**: Is a story quality kept after change? Does the story remain clear and enjoyable?
 - **Theme**: Was theme change successful? Are the new elements integrated naturally?
 - **Roleplaying**: Does a story fit a character/theme?

Create at least 10 rewrites with 3 points, 10 rewrites with at least 2 points and 10 rewrutes with at least 1 point.

---

## 5. Add an Educational Layer

Revise the story to include simple explanations about:
 - **Geography:** Characters visit real places, mention simple facts.
 - **Science:** Simple explanations (volcanoes, rainbows, magnets).
 - **History:** Introduce a figure/event, keep it fun and light.
 - **Math:** Counting, shapes, puzzles, or logic for older kids.
 - Or others curriculum-aligned  opics.

Prompts:
> Add information about material properties (e.g., wood, metal) to the story and use these properties in story events and the character's decisions.

> Revise the story to include a simple explanation about how volcanoes erupt. Make sure it fits the adventure and is easy for a {age}-year-old to understand.

## 6. Evaluation

 - **Story Quality**: Is a story quality kept after change? Does the story remain clear and enjoyable?
 - **Naturalness**: Is the fact blended into the story seamlessly?
 - **Correctness**: Are ALL facts accurate?

---

## 7. Generate Questions and Responses (JSON)

Prompt:
> Generate three questions and responses as a JSON dictionary that check the listener's knowledge about the material properties mentioned in the story.

**Example JSON Output:**

```json
{
  "Why did he select an iron sword instead a gold one?": "Iron is harder than gold, golden one would break",
  "What did the compass help them do?": "It helped them find north through the fog",
  "Which object floated: the wooden raft or the rock?": "The raft floated because wood is less dense than water"
}
```

Use [JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/) to validate your structure.

## 8. Evaluation

 - **Difficulty:** Are questions adequate for a given child’s age?
 - **Completeness:** Are questions testing knowledge from story?
 - **Correctness:** Are responses correct?

---

## 9. Annotation Instructions

You will review stories written by others and annotate them using yes/no checkboxes.
You are requested to annotate at least 60 items per category (240 total).

Annotations should be honest and constructive. Nobody won't be penalized for receiving low scores.

Each section has its own criteria, always marked 0 or 1:

### Category 1: LLM Story

- Age Appropriateness
- Clarity & Coherence
- Creativity & Engagement
- Language & Style
- Message/Moral
- Literature Quality

### Category 2: Theme Transformation

- Story Quality
- Theme
- Roleplaying

### Category 3: Education

- Story Quality
- Naturalness
- Correctness

### Category 4: Questions

- Difficulty
- Completeness
- Correctness

---

## Deliverables

- All prompts (with placeholders), placeholder values (as JSON), and LLM responses (with placeholders filled), 30 per section (120 total) inserted into a annotation interface.
- Peer annotations (60 per section, 240 total) done in the annotation interface.
- Final reflection comparing strategies (200+ words):
    - Did the educational content enhance or disrupt the story?
    - Were all facts accurate and explanations clear?
    - Did you find single or multi-prompt strategies better?
    - What worked, what didn’t, and what would you do differently?
